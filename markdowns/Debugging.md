# Advanced Breakpoints

Xcode breakpoints offer a number of different features and making use of them we can bring our debug experience to another level.

- Add actions and conditions
- Inject code instructions at runtime
- Automate repetitive steps among tests
- Configure breakpoints for your user
- Share breakpoints with your team
- Improve Exception Breakpoint usage

# UIDebuggingInformationOverlay

`UIDebuggingInformationOverlay` is a private `UIWindow` subclass created by Apple, presumably to help developers and designers debug Apple‚Äôs own iOS apps.

```Swift
let overlay = NSClassFromString("UIDebuggingInformationOverlay")
as? UIWindow.Type
_ = overlay?.perform(NSSelectorFromString("prepareDebuggingOverlay"))
```
