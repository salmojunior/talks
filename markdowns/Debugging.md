# Advanced Breakpoints

Xcode breakpoints offers us serveral great features in order to improve our debug experience, pushing us to another level as developers.

- Add conditions and actions
- Inject code instructions at runtime
- Automate repetitive steps among tests
- Configure breakpoints for your user
- Share breakpoints with your team
- Improve Exception Breakpoint usage

---

# Adding conditions and actions

Conditional breakpoints will only break when the condition is true, and any valid code that evaluates to a boolean can be used here. You can also use any variable available on the same scope where the break point is placed.

# Injecting code instructions at runtime

Stop adding hard-coded data during repetitive tests. It‚Äôs dangerous. With breakpoint actions and lldb expressions, there‚Äôs no need to rebuild the app.

# Improving Exception Breakpoint usage

All Exceptions breakpoint helps stopping right before a crash but sometimes it is not clear. Type **po $arg1** into the debug area to get the human-readable version of the error.

# Improving Exception Breakpoint usage

Making it even better. Edit your breakpoint and send it to your Xcode User and it will be available for all projects.

# Breakpoint Shortcuts üòÅ

Add/Remove breakpoint  =  command +  \\

Edit breakpoint  =  command + option + click

# LLDB Debugger Commands

- Type Lookup
- Watchpoints
- Import Frameworks

---

# Type Lookup

The type lookup command allows you to get information about any type in the system.
Basically it's a header-like representation that you can get right there in the debugger to remind you about the contents of the type.

---

# Watchpoints

Watchpoint stops execution whenever the value of an expression changes, without having to predict a particular place where this may happen.

```
watchpoint set variable self.myProperty
watchpoint list
watchpoint delete <number>
```

<br>

Number of supported hardware watchpoints: 4

# Import Frameworks

When **lldb** is not able to print an object type properly, a simple *import* can fix it and improve the output message.

# View Debugging

- Xcode View Debugging
- iOS Simulator Debug
- UIDebuggingInformationOverlay

---

# Xcode View Debugging

Available since Xcode 6 this feature helps to analize view layers and easily identify and fix issues in an app's user interface.

# iOS Simulator Debug

Simulator has some great features on Debug menu option to help you find issues on app's user interface.

# UIDebuggingInformationOverlay

`UIDebuggingInformationOverlay` is a private `UIWindow` subclass created by Apple, presumably to help developers and designers debug Apple‚Äôs own iOS apps.

```Swift
let overlay = NSClassFromString("UIDebuggingInformationOverlay")
as? UIWindow.Type
_ = overlay?.perform(NSSelectorFromString("prepareDebuggingOverlay"))
```
